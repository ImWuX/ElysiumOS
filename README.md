ElysiumOS is a 64bit hobby operating system designed mainly by me (@WuX). Elysium currently only supports the x86_64 architecture, though support for Aarch64 is planned.

## Development
The [.vscode](./.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json) contains an example configuration for vscode. For other IDE's infer setup from this configuration. For initial setup run the `dev_setup` make target to tell chariot to generate the necessary headers.
